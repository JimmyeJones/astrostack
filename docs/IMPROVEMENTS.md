# AstroStack improvement backlog

The shared blackboard for autonomous development. Read
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first — it defines the loop, the decision
framework, and the guardrails. This file is *what* to build; AGENTS.md is *how*.

**Conventions**
- Sections: **In progress** → **Ideas** (roughly prioritised) → **Shipped** →
  **Needs owner sign-off**.
- A new agent runs hourly and lands **several tasks per run**. Claim each item by
  moving it to **In progress** with your branch name, in the same commit that
  starts it. Move it to **Shipped** (with the commit/PR) when done, or back to
  **Ideas** if you abandon it.
- **Replenish the backlog every run.** Using AGENTS.md §4 (the ideation process),
  add at least one or two well-reasoned new ideas per run so this list never runs
  dry. Keep entries to a one-liner with a short "why", a rough size (S/M/L), and
  the pillar it serves (scale / correctness / approachability).

## In progress

_(none — claim an item here with your branch name)_

## Ideas (pick roughly top-down; use the value ÷ effort×risk rule)

### Correctness & robustness (highest priority)
- Audit NaN/coverage handling on the newer paths (calibration, mono, channel
  combine) for single-frame and mosaic-edge cases. Add edge-case tests. (S–M)
- Flat calibration: optionally dark-subtract the flat before normalising
  (flat-dark support) for more correct flats. Currently mean-normalised only. (M)
- Channel combine: reproject stacks that don't share a canvas (via WCS) instead
  of erroring, so filters shot in separate sessions can be combined. (M–L)
- Property/edge tests for `run_stack`: empty input, all-rejected, 1 frame,
  drizzle vs sigma-clip parity on a synthetic scene. (M)

### Features that serve real workflows
- Compare-two-stacks web view (side-by-side / blink) to judge setting changes. (M)
- Settings + presets export/import (backup & restore a config). (S)
- Annotated sky overlay (label detected objects / show solved field). (M)
- Drizzle memory estimate surfaced in the Stack form before you run it. (S)
- Star-mask preview toggle in the editor (visualise the mask driving star ops). (S)
- More export options / metadata in FITS/TIFF (instrument, exposure totals). (S)
- Per-target "notes/tags" search improvements and saved filters in Library. (S)

### UX & polish
- Mobile layout polish across the newer pages (Calibration, Combine). (S)
- Better empty-states and error messages on long-running jobs. (S)
- Keyboard shortcuts beyond the frame grader (e.g. editor undo/redo hints). (S)

### Performance (only with a measurement)
- Profile the stack hot path on a large synthetic target; find a safe win that
  doesn't touch memory bounds or correctness. (M)

### Infra / maintainability
- Add a `SessionStart` hook (or a `scripts/setup.sh`) that provisions the venv +
  `npm ci` so every autonomous iteration starts from a known-green baseline. (S)
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions) running the Python + frontend suites on PRs, so
  autonomous PRs are gated by real checks. (S–M)
- Reduce the frontend bundle warning (code-split the heavy Sky/aladin chunks). (S)
- Expand `docs/` (webapp.md) to cover calibration, mono/LRGB, auth. (S)

---

## Needs owner sign-off (do NOT start autonomously)
- AI star removal (StarNet-class ONNX): high wow-factor but adds a heavy ML
  runtime + model download that may hit the network policy. Needs an explicit OK.
- Anything that exposes the app publicly, changes auth defaults (e.g. turning auth
  on by default), or is otherwise hard to reverse.
- Live capture / real-time Seestar streaming integrations (explicitly de-scoped).

_(Normal, tested changes merge to the default branch automatically — see
AGENTS.md §8. Only the items above need a human's OK first.)_

---

## Shipped
_Newest first. One line each: what + commit/PR._

- Autonomous dev playbook (`AGENTS.md`) + this backlog.
- Mono stacking + LRGB/RGB channel combine — `StackOptions.mono`, `channel_combine`,
  combine job/endpoint, Channel combine page. (v0.12.0, `9485e28`)
- Star-mask-aware local edits — `edit/starmask.py`, mask-gated `stars.reduce`,
  new `stars.boost_nebula`. (v0.11.0, `d33c7c9`)
- Optional HTTP Basic access control (opt-in, PBKDF2, middleware). (v0.10.0, `7a995fc`)
- Dark/flat calibration — engine, master store, build job, API, UI. (v0.9.0)
- Keyboard shortcuts for frame grading on the Target page. (`2de2099`)
- Sigma-clip fix: no longer over-clips single-coverage (mosaic-edge) pixels. (`ab3883d`)
