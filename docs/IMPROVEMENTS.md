# AstroStack improvement backlog

The shared blackboard for autonomous development. Read
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first — it defines the loop, the decision
framework, and the guardrails. This file is *what* to build; AGENTS.md is *how*.

**Conventions**
- Sections: **In progress** → **Ideas** (roughly prioritised) → **Shipped** →
  **Needs owner sign-off**.
- A new agent runs hourly and lands **several tasks per run**. Claim each item by
  moving it to **In progress** with your branch name, in the same commit that
  starts it. Move it to **Shipped** (with the commit/PR) when done, or back to
  **Ideas** if you abandon it.
- **Replenish the backlog every run.** Using AGENTS.md §4 (the ideation process),
  add at least one or two well-reasoned new ideas per run so this list never runs
  dry. Keep entries to a one-liner with a short "why", a rough size (S/M/L), and
  the pillar it serves (scale / correctness / approachability).

## In progress

_(none — claim an item here with your branch name)_

---

## Ideas (pick roughly top-down; use the value ÷ effort×risk rule)

### Correctness & robustness (highest priority)
- Audit NaN/coverage handling on the newer paths (calibration, mono) for
  single-frame and mosaic-edge cases. Add edge-case tests. (S–M) — *channel
  combine done this run (v0.14.1); calibration/mono still to audit.*
- Flat calibration: optionally dark-subtract the flat before normalising
  (flat-dark support) for more correct flats. Currently mean-normalised only. (M)
- Channel combine: reproject stacks that don't share a canvas (via WCS) instead
  of erroring, so filters shot in separate sessions can be combined. (M–L)
- Property/edge tests for `run_stack`: empty input, all-rejected, 1 frame,
  drizzle vs sigma-clip parity on a synthetic scene. (M)
- Seestar client (`webapp/seestar/client.py`) has no reconnect/retry on a
  dropped TCP socket — a flaky Wi-Fi link to the scope currently requires
  the user to manually reconnect via the UI. Core hardware-integration
  path; needs care around not spamming reconnect attempts and should be
  testable in isolation from real hardware. (M, correctness)

### Features that serve real workflows
- Compare-two-stacks web view (side-by-side / blink) to judge setting changes. (M)
- Annotated sky overlay (label detected objects / show solved field). (M)
- Drizzle memory estimate surfaced in the Stack form before you run it. (S)
- Star-mask preview toggle in the editor (visualise the mask driving star ops). (S)
- Per-target "notes/tags" search improvements and saved filters in Library. (S)

### UX & polish
- Mobile layout polish across the newer pages (Calibration, Combine). (S)
- Better empty-states and error messages on long-running jobs. (S)
- Keyboard shortcuts beyond the frame grader (e.g. editor undo/redo hints). (S)

### Performance (only with a measurement)
- Profile the stack hot path on a large synthetic target; find a safe win that
  doesn't touch memory bounds or correctness. (M)

### Infra / maintainability
- Chip away at the ~127 pre-existing `ruff check .` findings (don't add new ones);
  consider wiring ruff into CI once the count is low. (L, correctness/maintainability)
- Add a retention/pruning policy for `jobs.sqlite` so the job history can't grow
  unbounded on a long-lived NAS deployment. (S, scale)
- `GET /api/stats` re-opens every target's SQLite project on each call — cache or
  batch it so the dashboard stays fast with many targets. (M, scale)
- Add a `SessionStart` hook (or a `scripts/setup.sh`) that provisions the venv +
  `npm ci` so every autonomous iteration starts from a known-green baseline. (S)
- Reduce the frontend bundle warning (code-split the heavy Sky/aladin chunks). (S)
- Expand `docs/` (webapp.md) to cover calibration, mono/LRGB, auth. (S)
- `npm audit` still reports `esbuild`≤0.24.2/`vite`≤6.4.2/`vitest`≤3.2.5
  (moderate — dev server only, not the production build) after this run's
  `react-router`/`form-data` fix. `npm audit fix --force` wants `vite@8`,
  a real major-version bump across the toolchain (config changes, full
  suite re-verification) — needs a deliberate dedicated pass per
  `AGENTS.md`'s major-dependency-bump sign-off rule, not a blind
  `--force`. (M)

---

## Needs owner sign-off (do NOT start autonomously)
- AI star removal (StarNet-class ONNX): high wow-factor but adds a heavy ML
  runtime + model download that may hit the network policy. Needs an explicit OK.
- Anything that exposes the app publicly, changes auth defaults (e.g. turning auth
  on by default), or is otherwise hard to reverse.
- Live capture / real-time Seestar streaming integrations (explicitly de-scoped).

_(Normal, tested changes merge to the default branch automatically — see
AGENTS.md §8. Only the items above need a human's OK first.)_

---

## Shipped
_Newest first. One line each: what + commit/PR._

- Accessibility sweep — added `aria-label` to the remaining icon-only
  `ActionIcon` buttons (frame accept/reject, delete calibration master, delete
  preset) so they have accessible names for screen readers, plus a test
  asserting the delete-master button is reachable by name. (v0.14.2, this run)

- Channel-combine NaN fix — LRGB pixels covered in G/B/L but uncovered in a
  colour channel now become cleanly uncovered (NaN) instead of `[NaN, 0, 0]`
  (which zeroed real G/B signal at mosaic edges). Added NaN/coverage +
  single-pixel edge tests. (v0.14.1, this run)

- Settings backup & restore — `GET /api/settings/export` (self-identifying JSON
  envelope, auth/derived fields excluded) + `POST /api/settings/import`
  (merge, validates → 422, ignores auth/unknown keys), with Export/Import
  buttons on the Settings page. (v0.14.0, this run)
- FITS export metadata — `master.fits` now carries standard integration cards
  (`NCOMBINE`, `EXPTIME`, `TOTALEXP`, `GAIN`, `CCD-TEMP`, `DATE-OBS`/`DATE-END`,
  `STACKMTD`, `CFA`) built by `build_stack_header_meta`, so the scientific
  output is self-describing in Siril/PixInsight. (v0.14.0, this run)

- CI safety net (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — full Python + frontend suites run
  on every PR and push to `main`; independent check on autonomous self-merges.

- **Autonomous run (agent, this session):** security fixes — Seestar `goto`
  RA/Dec bounds validation, closed a quick-look-preview gap in the
  `output_name` sanitizer (`_save_quick_look` built its own unsanitized
  filename), `react-router`/`form-data` CVE patches (`npm audit fix`) —
  plus `lucky_fraction` bounds validation, confirm+error-surfacing on
  stack-run deletion (`History.tsx`), job-cancel error feedback and a
  Logs-download filter bug (`Jobs.tsx`/`Logs.tsx`). Reconciled with a
  concurrent autonomous run that independently fixed the `bayer`
  path-traversal and `output_name` sanitizer issues and its own take on
  the `History.tsx` delete confirmation — merged rather than duplicated.
- **Autonomous run #1 (agent):** security + reliability/operability hardening +
  frontend error states — `output_name` sanitizer, `bayer` param validation, 404s
  for unknown targets, settings bounds (pydantic `Field` ge/le + 422), jobs-list
  clamp, shared `QueryError` component across 7 routes, editor-op pixel tests.
  (PR #28)
- Autonomous dev playbook (`AGENTS.md`) + this backlog.
- Mono stacking + LRGB/RGB channel combine — `StackOptions.mono`, `channel_combine`,
  combine job/endpoint, Channel combine page. (v0.12.0, `9485e28`)
- Star-mask-aware local edits — `edit/starmask.py`, mask-gated `stars.reduce`,
  new `stars.boost_nebula`. (v0.11.0, `d33c7c9`)
- Optional HTTP Basic access control (opt-in, PBKDF2, middleware). (v0.10.0, `7a995fc`)
- Dark/flat calibration — engine, master store, build job, API, UI. (v0.9.0)
- Keyboard shortcuts for frame grading on the Target page. (`2de2099`)
- Sigma-clip fix: no longer over-clips single-coverage (mosaic-edge) pixels. (`ab3883d`)
